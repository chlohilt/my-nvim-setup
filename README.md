# My NeoVim set up
# test 
## Done
- [X] Added line #s using `set number`
- [X] Added nice colorscheme (terafox) using EdenEast nightfox plugin--terafox version
- [X] figure out how to actually get to end of a line (can only get cursor on last char, not after) *use a button to go after a char

## TODO
- [ ] get nvim cmp to autocomplete stuff
- [ ] install plugin for Git Blame
- [ ] add tabs, maybe with tabby (https://github.com/nanozuki/tabby.nvim)
- [ ] add status line, maybe with feline (https://github.com/freddiehaddad/feline.nvim)
- [ ] figure out split terminals (not supported in GitBash I believe besides using different tabs)
- [ ] map :tabn and tabp to F7 and F8
