# My NeoVim set up

## Done
- Added line #s
- Added nice colorscheme (terafox)

## TODO
- [ ] get nvim cmp to autocomplete stuff
- [ ] install plugin for Git Blame
- [ ] figure out how to actually get to end of a line (can only get cursor on last char, not after)
- [ ] add tabs, maybe with tabby (https://github.com/nanozuki/tabby.nvim)
- [ ] add status line, maybe with feline (https://github.com/nanozuki/tabby.nvim)
