# My NeoVim set up

## Done
- [X] Added line #s using `set number`
- [X] Added nice colorscheme (terafox) using EdenEast nightfox plugin--terafox version
- [X] figure out how to actually get to end of a line (can only get cursor on last char, not after) *use a button to go after a char*
- [X] figure out split terminals (not supported in GitBash I believe besides using different tabs)
- [X] add status line, maybe with feline (https://github.com/freddiehaddad/feline.nvim)
- [X] set up nvim-telescope for fuzzy finder
- [X] set up NerdFont for pretty text (instead just adjusted Git Bash font)
- [X] figure out what's wrong with GitBash + windows so I can run external commands!! (using :term)
- [X] add mapping for saving files (:w -> Ctrl s)
- [X] get nvim cmp to autocomplete stuff
