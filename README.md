## Done
- [X] Added line #s using `set number`
- [X] Added nice colorscheme (terafox) using EdenEast nightfox plugin--terafox version
- [X] figure out how to actually get to end of a line (can only get cursor on last char, not after) *use a button to go after a char*
- [X] figure out split terminals (not supported in GitBash I believe besides using different tabs)
